<ol>
<li> He says things like this in <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html"/>speeches</a> that are ostensibly about Perl but really are about postmodernist culture and life:
<blockquote>
True greatness is measured by how much freedom you give to others, not by how much you can coerce others to do what you want.
</blockquote>
</li>

<li> He has 4 extremely intelligent children, one of whom is a postdoctorate student in physics studying BLACK HOLES.</li>

And on that second point: his son's name is Aron Wall, and he wrote <a href="http://www.wall.org/~aron/horizon.htm"/>this highly readable primer</a> on black holes - what they really are, why light can't escape (hint: it's because once you/anything crosses the event horizon, the black hole moves AWAY FROM YOU/ANYTHING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT OMFGGGGG!!!), and why they portend the next massive revolution of thought in theoretical physics as we know it.

Whew. 

Thanks Larry Wall. You're a real mensch.

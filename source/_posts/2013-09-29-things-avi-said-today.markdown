I love errors. I can’t wait to get past one and say, “Great, I wonder what my next error is?!”

The answer is in the error itself. Read the entire thing, even the parts that make no sense.

Read error messages backwards. (You shut off your brain’s interpretation & are forced to read each word individually.)

Abstraction in Ruby is the act of hiding away details.

Beautiful code looks beautiful. Fast code is not beautiful code.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). One part of a program is responsible for one thing & one thing only.

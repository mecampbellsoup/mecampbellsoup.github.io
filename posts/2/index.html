  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently here at Flatiron we&rsquo;ve begun to write our code with a focus on object orientation. To a beginner, this sentence has absolutely zero meaning whatsoever - so let&rsquo;s take a step back and define some terms.</p>

<p>First of all, there are a couple truisms to keep in mind when it comes to code:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, in case you haven&#8217;t heard yet, things are going to change. Your application will grow in users; new technologies will emerge; your investors will want you to add new features (talk about a first world problem!). Your code base needs to be flexible when it comes to making changes for any of these reasons - flexible like a reed in the wind, as opposed to brittle like, say, graphite. As Sandi Metz puts it: 
<blockquote><em>
Changing requirements are the programming equivalent of friction and gravity.
</em></blockquote>
</li></ul>


<p><br>
Ok, great! So we know change is a-comin&#8217;. How do we structure our code to be prepared like the Boy Scouts?</p>

<ul>
<li>The less the different segments of your code base know about one another, the better! Admittedly, this one is a bit counterintuitive. In life, we&#8217;re typically used to setting all of our ducks in a row before taking any major steps or jumping off any cliffs (figuratively speaking, for the most part). We&#8217;re naturally pretty risk averse, and we routinely succumb to the delusion that we can mitigate risk and uncertainty a bit by lining up said ducks. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re trying to tear the mask of the unknown off so that we can make decisions today with perfect information. Programmers have adopted a different approach: instead of trying to know and discount the future, they simply design programs that will adapt easily, fullstop. Note I&#8217;ve made no assumption about what changes will emerge to throw our programs for a loop; the emphasis is on a coding paradigm in which your different segments can easily change how they communicate with one another. This is what people mean when they talk about the principle of object-oriented design. Once again, let&#8217;s get Sandi&#8217;s take:
<blockquote><em>
In the absence of design, unmanaged dependencies wreak havoc because objects know too muchabout one another. Changing one object forces change upon its collaborators, whichin turn, forces change upon its collaborators, ad infinitum.
</em></blockquote>
</li></ul>


<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at some code. Let&rsquo;s try to build a bicycle in Ruby - first we&rsquo;ll eschew the object-oriented princples just discussed, and then we&rsquo;ll embrace them. Hopefully the proof is in the pudding!</p>

<p>First, the painful, hard-to-read &amp; -follow version…</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mecampbellsoup/6900628.js"></script>


<p>Whew, that was pretty exhausting and hard to follow. Let&rsquo;s see what happens if we segregate along natural, real-world dividing lines…</p>

<li> He says things like this in <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html"/>speeches</a> that are ostensibly about Perl but really are about postmodernist culture and life:
<blockquote>
True greatness is measured by how much freedom you give to others, not by how much you can coerce others to do what you want.
</blockquote>
</li></p>

<p><li> He has 4 extremely intelligent children, one of whom is a postdoctorate student in physics studying BLACK HOLES.</li></p>

<p>And on that second point: his son&rsquo;s name is Aron Wall, and he wrote <a href="http://www.wall.org/~aron/horizon.htm"/>this highly readable primer</a> on black holes - what they really are, why light can&rsquo;t escape (hint: it&rsquo;s because once you/anything crosses the event horizon, the black hole moves AWAY FROM YOU/ANYTHING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT OMFGGGGG!!!), and why they portend the next massive revolution of thought in theoretical physics as we know it.</p>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>Thanks Larry Wall. You&rsquo;re a real mensch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>How is program scope like a cell membrane?</h3>

<p>Scope is the context within which something is defined. Let&rsquo;s focus on methods, for starters. If you write a page of code with a method in it, alongside a bunch of other stuff (variable declarations, enumerators/iterators not contained in that method, etc.), don&rsquo;t expect your method to have any clue what&rsquo;s going on above or below it in that page. Sorry, that explanation sucked - let me show an example:</p>

<pre><code>some_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
another_variable = {:cell_membrane =&gt; "cytosol", :receptor =&gt; "ligand"}
more_variables = some_numbers.collect do |num|
    num * 2
end

def method_in_same_code_file(args)
    more_variables + some_numbers ##=&gt; This method doesn't know what these are!! 
end
</code></pre>

<p>The way that we get around this issue of restrictive method scope in Ruby&rsquo;s design is actually something we all are quite familiar with: <em>passing arguments to our methods.</em> Perhaps you can imagine now the similarity to a cell membrane - take a look at the image below. I would sa the receptor-ligand binding is a lot like doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;page of code omitted… let's just call the method&gt;
method_in_same_code_file(some_numbers, more_variables)
</code></pre>

<p>In this method call, our arguments works just like our receptor-ligand binding! Put differently: the arguments function as the cell membrane&rsquo;s receptors, in that only by going through them can stuff on the outside be itelligible/readable to the method&rsquo;s insides.</p>

<p>Method scope visualization!</p>

<p><img src="http://fwcdscience.wikispaces.com/file/view/transduction.gif/43381569/transduction.gif"></p>

<h3>cool things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> has said (about programming):</h3>

<p>One line methods are there to communicate.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t spend three or four lines expressing iteration, you spend one word.</p>

<p>YAGNI: You aren&rsquo;t going to need it.</p>

<p>Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment.</p>

<p>(Speaking about his Chrysler experience…) By far the dominant reason for not releasing sooner was a reluctance to trade the dream of success for the reality of feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Make it work, make it right, make it fast.</strong></p>

<h3>how to write a basic test/spec:</h3>

<pre><code>def assert_equal(actual, expected)
    unless actual == expected
        puts "fail: expected #{expected} but got #{actual}"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Not so bad, right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Flatiron, Day 4:</p>

<p>First, some things Avi said today:</p>

<blockquote>

Iteration is about going over a collection of objects. Enumeration is the same thing but you’re given the objects.<br/>

object.method… the dot is called dot notation. It’s how we send messages to objects.<br/>

.. (read: ‘dot dot’) is a literal constructor for Range.<br/>

You need to keep “rf -rf /” handy. You know, in case of those Terminator situations.<br/>

Comptuer languages fall into 2 categories: those designed for human problems, and those designed for computer problems. JavaScript was designed to be read quickly by web browsers (i.e. a computer problem).<br/>

Computers will get faster, but people won’t get any smarter.
</blockquote>


<p>Now, on to the post subject&hellip; let&rsquo;s walk stepwise through a (very) simple program in Ruby:</p>

<p>Step 0:</p>

<pre><code>x = 1
if x == 1
    puts "x is equal to 1!"
end
</code></pre>

<p>Step 1:</p>

<pre><code>if 1 == 1
    puts "x is equal to 1!"
end
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2:</p>

<pre><code>if true
    puts "x is equal to 1!"
end
</code></pre>

<p>Step 3:</p>

<pre><code>puts "x is equal to 1!"  #=&gt; "x is equal to 1!"
</code></pre>

<p>FizzBuzz ultimate solution:</p>

<pre><code>def fizzbuzz (i)
    [("fizz" if i % 3 == 0), ("buzz" if i % 5 == 0)].join
end
</code></pre>

<p>case vs. if</p>

<pre><code>if x == 1
    puts "x wins"
elsif o == 1
    puts "o wins"
end
</code></pre>

<p>case object  # only can check if condition applies to one object</p>

<p>when condition # condition cannot be a logical operand; must use if/end if you want a unique logic applied for each &ldquo;case&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Simply put, the last 48 hours have been a whirlwind. On Monday, the 4th semeseter of Flatiron School kicked off with me riding shotgun. Today I turned my computer into a fully-customized, command-line-driven learning (and coding) machine over the course of about 12 hours. We’ve basically become proficient in using Git/GitHub as well – no small feat for those who recall trying to quickly climb the surprisingly steep Git learning curve. I want to focus this blog on the amazing things I’ll be learning, for example some of the incredible BASH functionality I’ve picked up recently.</p>

<p>But before doing that, I want to share a story. The story is about a man who decided to spend 9 days in the wilderness with a small group of people, each person carrying only a pocket knife, clothing and some sleeping gear. To set the stage a bit, envision this: you’re dropped in the New Mexican mesas with no food for 7 days, no tents, and you must learn how to start fires by rubbing two sticks together (which takes a day and a half on your first try). Yea, no joke. The insane man’s inspiration for going on this trip?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.zawaj.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/scenic-sunrays-on-forest-stream.jpg"></p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Perspective.</strong> He’d never spent time outside of civilization. I believe the man had a longing to know how our ancestors used to live not even ~300 years ago.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Back to Basics.</strong> Modern life has abstracted away so much of the inner machinations of… well, everything. This is true to such an extent that most people no longer have any idea how our most important tools work - think combustion engines, computers, and the Internet, just to name a few. What about a friggin’ microwave, or CERN, or the Hubble Telescope?!
</li>
<li>
<strong>Embracing Discomfort as a Means for Learning.</strong> As a result of #2, relative to pre-modern man the flow of our lives has flipped completely on its head: we now enjoy long periods of relative tranquility (i.e. we aren’t freezing, starving, or in imminent danger) only very briefly interrupted with moments of discomfort (e.g. our waiter wasn’t exceptionally polite & servile).
You may be wondering: So what? What’s the issue with leading a life characterized by an uninterrupted flow of pleasure and leisure? Isn’t that the goal of a well-functioning, capitalistic society?
</li>
</ol>


<p>The problem is that when all of our problems are solved for us and the solutions are abstracted away, <em>we forget how to solve our own problems.</em> Along the way, we never learn how to consistently approach problems with an open &amp; creative mindset. Hell, we even forget how to recognize a problem in the first place! (Example: many Americans stil do not have access to the Internet. Oh, add healthcare to that list of basic things everyone should have access to today.)</p>

<p>Think of every banker in New York City. Their problems consist of getting their children into the 92nd Street Y preschool; securing a bigger bonus than that other VP they work with; or choosing between the BMW X5 and the Volvo equivalent (since, ya’ know, it’s super safe and all). I don’t mean to triviliaze these people’s existence – I worked in finance for 3 years myself, whatever it’s worth. Rather, I want to point out something that I’ve been gnawing on for a long time: I think that our striving for wealth &amp; comfort (not the subsistence type, but rather the type that screams “… but I have more things than anyone else in this village!”) is utterly misplaced, and has eradicated a good chunk of our collective genius.</p>

<p>Our human legacy can take whatever form we as a species strive for it to take. Like the man who nearly starved over 9 days hiking in the wilderness, let’s try to preserve &amp; even expand our perspective regarding our place on earth. Let’s interrupt the ultimately meaningless and vapid pursuit of über-comfort that constantly distracts us from connecting with one another at a deep, real level. It’s up to each one of us to ensure the human legacy – our sacred imprimitur on the universe – is a worthy one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love errors. I can’t wait to get past one and say, “Great, I wonder what my next error is?!”</p>

<p>The answer is in the error itself. Read the entire thing, even the parts that make no sense.</p>

<p>Read error messages backwards. (You shut off your brain’s interpretation &amp; are forced to read each word individually.)</p>

<p>Abstraction in Ruby is the act of hiding away details.</p>

<p>Beautiful code looks beautiful. Fast code is not beautiful code.</p>

<p>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). One part of a program is responsible for one thing &amp; one thing only.</p>

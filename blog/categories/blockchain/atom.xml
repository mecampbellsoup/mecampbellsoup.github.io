<em>WorldWideWebCoin - WWWCoin vs. Bitcoin - More usefulness leads to more adoption leads to more usefulness</em>
</sub></p>

<p>Bitcoin is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/what-is-bitcoin?locale=en">many things</a> - open source peer-to-peer (p2p) digital money; an <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/18/winklevoss-state-street-bitcoin-etf-administrator/">alternative asset class for investors</a>; and possibly the global reserve currency of the future, when <a href="https://startupboy.com/2014/04/01/the-fifth-protocol/">machines are participating in marketplaces autonomously without human intervention</a>.</p>

<p>The value of one Bitcoin (1 BTC) in essence is a reflection of its <strong>usefulness</strong> across the many functions in which it&rsquo;s being used.</p>

<p>Bitcoin starts to look more like a safe haven asset that&rsquo;s decorrelated with, say, the S&amp;P500? Its value should increase.</p>

<p>Bitcoin can be used more and more places to buy goods and services? Its value should increase.</p>

<p>More companies offer employees compensation partially of wholly in Bitcoin? Its value should increase.</p>

<h2>WWWCoin Hypothetical Price History</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say there had been a <strong>WWWCoin</strong> back in 1994 shortly after Tim Burners-Lee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">invented the World Wide Web</a> in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>Now picture a chart of that coin&rsquo;s valuation from its inception in c. 1989; through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dot-com bubble&rsquo;s bursting</a> beginning in 2000; and finally bring it through to the present. What would that chart look like? Here&rsquo;s my take&hellip;</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Realized Price History</h2>

<p>Just for fun, let&rsquo;s see how our hypothetical WWWCoin chart compares to the realized BTC price chart to date.</p>

<p>Some similarities of note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early precipitous rise leads to a bubble, i.e. overdone price increase relative to the <strong>actual + potential usefulness of both the internet and Bitcoin</strong></li>
<li>Steady, grinding recovery following the first major crash in price as <strong>the technology continues to make strides in terms of usefulness and applicability</strong></li>
<li><strong>No clear upper bound on price as usefulness enters into a virtuous feedback loop</strong> - more adoption means more usefulness means more adoption, ad nauseam.</li>
</ul>


<p>The last point has only been realized to date in the case of the Internet; my prediction is Bitcoin will follow a similar pattern. Have you heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment">micropayments</a>? The technology that will finally <a href="https://medium.com/on-blendle/in-a-world-of-ad-blockers-we-need-micropayments-9ddb2f6793cf#.cn7bn57v8">kill YouTube ads</a>? Well, they&rsquo;re almost here, courtesy of Bitcoin and the <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a>.</p>

<p>I think we&rsquo;re standing on the precipice of an inflection point in Bitcoin&rsquo;s history - at which the feedback between Bitcoin&rsquo;s expanding utility and increasing price becomes obvious to just about everyone. Do you want to participate or not?</p>
